# DeployX Full Roadmap — Phases 1-14

## Completed Phases (1-7)

| Phase | Name | What Was Built | Tests Added |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Monorepo (turborepo), Supabase schema, 17 tables, 40+ RLS policies | — |
| 2 | Pipeline Engine | YAML parser (Zod), DAG resolution (Kahn's algorithm), state machine | +53 |
| 3 | Auth & Dashboard | GitHub OAuth (PKCE), org auto-provisioning, project CRUD, runner CLI | +40 |
| 4 | Container Factory | Real execution (execa), Docker BuildKit builds, log streaming, variable interpolation | +66 |
| 5 | Blue-Green Deployment | Docker-local deployer, nginx reverse proxy, health probes, port allocation | +28 |
| 6 | Self-Healing & Observability | Health monitor, remediation engine, auto-rollback, DAG viz (@xyflow/react), metrics UI | +63 |
| 7 | Secrets & Actions | AES-256-GCM secrets, cancel run, approval votes | +25 |

**Total after Phase 7: 284 tests, 4/4 Turborepo tasks build**

## Remaining Phases (8-13)

### Phase 8: Team Management & RBAC Enforcement

Wire up existing RBAC infrastructure (DB tables, RLS policies, 4-role hierarchy) with API endpoints and UI.

**Features:**
- Real member listing from `org_memberships` + `user_profiles`
- Invite flow with `org_invites` table
- Role management (admin+ can change roles via dropdown)
- Member removal (admin+ can remove, owner protected)
- Permission enforcement in `triggerPipelineRun`, `rollbackDeployment`, `submitApprovalVote`, secret CRUD
- Pending invite acceptance flow for invited users

**Core Deliverable:** D1 Control Plane, Special Feature: RBAC

---

### Phase 9: Webhook Triggers & GitHub Integration

GitHub pushes automatically trigger pipeline runs.

**Features:**
- Webhook receiver (`POST /api/webhooks/github/[projectId]`)
- GitHub HMAC SHA-256 signature verification
- Push event parsing → auto-trigger matching pipeline
- Per-project webhook secret (reuses `project_secrets`)
- Webhook config UI + delivery history

**Core Deliverable:** D2 Pipeline Engine

---

### Phase 10: Scheduled Triggers & Metrics Dashboard

Cron-based pipeline scheduling + analytics dashboard using existing `pipeline_metrics` table.

**Features:**
- `pipeline_schedules` table with cron expressions
- Schedule CRUD UI with presets (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Scheduler execution via API route + external cron
- Analytics page: success rate trends, duration percentiles, MTTR
- Dashboard stat cards wired to real data
- Log search + level filter on run detail
- Health check time-series chart on deployment detail

**Core Deliverable:** D2 Pipeline Engine, D5 Observability Layer

---

### Phase 11: Canary & Rolling Deployment Strategies

Implement remaining deployment strategies via existing `DeployerDriver` interface.

**Features:**
- Canary: nginx upstream weights, staged promotion (10%→25%→50%→100%), auto-rollback
- Rolling: ordinal instance replacement, health gate between each, configurable maxUnavailable
- Strategy-specific visualization on deployment detail page
- Extended `DeployConfigSchema` with canary/rolling config fields

**Core Deliverable:** D4 Orchestrator, Special Feature: Blue-green/canary

---

### Phase 12: External Deployers (Railway & Fly.io)

Replace `NotImplementedError` stubs with real deployer drivers.

**Features:**
- `RailwayDeployer` via Railway API v2
- `FlyDeployer` via Fly Machines API
- API token credential management via project secrets
- External health checking (HTTP-only, no Docker inspect)
- Deploy target selection UI on project creation

**Core Deliverable:** D4 Orchestrator, D3 Container Factory

---

### Phase 13: Advanced Observability & Predictive Features

Capstone phase — intelligent CI/CD with operational insights.

**Features:**
- SLA/uptime dashboard from `health_check_results`
- Alert rules with configurable thresholds
- In-app notifications via Supabase Realtime
- Audit log (`audit_events` table)
- Build duration prediction (moving average)
- Failure risk indicator
- Build artifact storage (Supabase Storage)
- Profile page

**Core Deliverable:** D5 Observability Layer, Special Feature: Predictive auto-scaling

---

### Phase 14: UI Hardening, Security Patches & Demo App

Post-launch fixes and developer experience improvements.

**Features:**
- Material Symbols icon font fix (missing `<link>` tag in root layout)
- Clickability audit: 23+ dead interactive elements fixed across 8 files
- `healing_events` RLS gap closed (org-scoped SELECT/INSERT policies)
- Storage bucket policies tightened (org-scoped via `storage.foldername()`)
- Sidebar spacing aligned with stitch design reference
- Demo app (`examples/demo-app/`) — reference implementation satisfying all DeployX contracts
- Root README with quick start, architecture overview, docs index
- Getting started guide (`docs/context/19-getting-started.md`)
- Requirements info box on new project creation form

**Core Deliverable:** Developer experience, security hardening
